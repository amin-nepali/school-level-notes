<h1>🌱 Long Answer Type Questions (Agriculture Notes)</h1>

<div class="card">
    <h2>1. Introduce macronutrients and micronutrients with examples.</h2>
    <p>
        Macronutrients are nutrients required by plants in large quantities such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. 
        Micronutrients are required in small amounts but are equally important, including iron, zinc, manganese, and copper. 
        Both types are necessary for proper growth, metabolism, and development of plants.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>2. What are chemical fertilizers? Explain their types and advantages.</h2>
    <p>
        Chemical fertilizers are inorganic nutrient-rich substances manufactured to supply essential nutrients to crops. 
        They are of three types: nitrogenous (urea), phosphatic (DAP), and potassic (MOP). 
        Their advantages include quick nutrient release, faster crop growth, increased yield, and easy transportation and application in modern farming.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>3. Outline the risks and benefits of insecticides used in agriculture, animals, and horticulture.</h2>
    <p>
        Insecticides kill harmful insects and protect crops, animals, and gardens, helping increase crop yield and prevent diseases. 
        However, excessive use leads to soil and water pollution, kills useful insects, harms human and animal health, and creates pesticide-resistant pests. 
        Their use must be controlled to avoid environmental damage.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>4. What are the disadvantages of using chemical fertilizers and insecticides?</h2>
    <p>
        Chemical fertilizers degrade soil fertility, reduce organic matter, cause water pollution, and increase soil acidity. 
        Insecticides contaminate food, kill beneficial insects, and may harm humans and animals. 
        Overuse leads to resistance in pests and increases long-term farming costs, making agriculture less sustainable.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>5. Write the symptoms of potassium and phosphorus deficiency in plants.</h2>
    <p>
        Potassium deficiency causes yellow or burnt leaf edges, weak stems, and poor disease resistance. 
        Phosphorus deficiency results in purple or reddish leaves, slow growth, and weak roots. 
        Both nutrients are essential for photosynthesis, energy transfer, and overall plant health.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>6. How is Jholmol made? Write the benefits of its application in crops.</h2>
    <p>
        Jholmol is made by fermenting cow dung, cow urine, green leaves, water, and other organic materials for several days. 
        It enriches the soil, controls pests naturally, increases microbial activity, and promotes healthy plant growth. 
        It is cheap, safe, and sustainable compared to chemical inputs.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>7. What are the precautions against using insecticides in crops?</h2>
    <p>
        Farmers should wear protective gloves and masks, use recommended doses, avoid spraying during windy or rainy weather, 
        and prevent spraying near water sources. Containers must be disposed properly. 
        Spraying should be avoided during flowering to protect pollinating insects like bees.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>8. How is compost manure made?</h2>
    <p>
        Compost is made by mixing dry leaves, kitchen waste, dung, and garden materials in a pit. 
        The mixture is kept moist and turned regularly for aerobic decomposition. 
        After a few weeks, it becomes dark and crumbly compost rich in organic matter, improving soil fertility and structure.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>9. Name at least three deficiency symptoms in plants and relate them with the concerned minerals.</h2>
    <p>
        Yellow leaves (chlorosis) occur due to nitrogen or iron deficiency. 
        Purple leaves appear due to phosphorus deficiency. 
        Burnt or yellow leaf edges occur due to potassium deficiency. 
        These symptoms arise because essential minerals required for chlorophyll, energy transfer, and cell function are lacking.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>10. Write any two reasons to justify that compost fertilizer is better than chemical fertilizer.</h2>
    <p>
        Compost increases soil organic matter and improves structure, while chemical fertilizers degrade soil quality over time. 
        Compost is natural, eco-friendly, and promotes beneficial microorganisms, whereas chemical fertilizers may pollute soil and water 
        and harm soil life.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>11. Write the advantages of chemical fertilizers with examples.</h2>
    <p>
        Chemical fertilizers supply nutrients quickly, helping crops grow faster. 
        Urea provides nitrogen, DAP supplies phosphorus, and MOP gives potassium. 
        They increase crop yield and support large-scale farming, especially where fast results are necessary.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>12. What are bio-insecticides? Write with examples.</h2>
    <p>
        Bio-insecticides are natural pest-control substances obtained from living organisms. 
        Examples include Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for caterpillars, neem extract for insects, 
        and fungal agents like Beauveria bassiana. 
        They are safe for the environment and reduce chemical pesticide use.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>13. What will be two alternative forms of fertilizers to chemical fertilizers and inorganic insecticides?</h2>
    <p>
        Two alternatives are organic fertilizers and bio-insecticides. 
        Organic fertilizers like compost, farmyard manure, and vermicompost enrich soil naturally. 
        Bio-insecticides such as neem oil, Bt, and Trichoderma fungus protect crops without pollution. 
        These methods promote sustainable and eco-friendly farming.

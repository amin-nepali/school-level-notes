<!-- LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS (25–35 words generally) -->
<h2>✍️ Long Answer Type Questions (Section 3 — p.160)</h2>
<div class="long">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>3.a</strong> A single fixed pulley gives no MA gain because it only changes direction of effort; it is used to make lifting convenient or to redirect force for safety.</li>

    <li><strong>3.b</strong> In block and tackle, MA increases with more pulleys because each added pulley increases the number of rope segments supporting the load, sharing the load among more tensions.</li>

    <li><strong>3.c</strong> <em>Uses:</em>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inclined plane</strong> — is used to load goods onto trucks and to design ramps for wheelchairs.</li>
        <li><strong>Pulley</strong> — is used in flagpoles and wells for lifting and in cranes to redirect forces.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheel and axle</strong> — is used in door knobs and rolling devices like carts to magnify force or motion.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>3.d</strong> To lift same load with less effort on an inclined plane — increase the plane length or reduce the slope angle so effort distance increases but required force decreases.</li>

    <li><strong>3.e</strong> Efficiency derivation (short): Efficiency = (output work / input work) × 100%. Output work is useful work, input work is effort×distance; ratio shows useful fraction of input.</li>

    <li><strong>3.f</strong> Wheelbarrow as compound machine — is called compound because it combines lever (handles and wheel axle) and wheel & axle to make lifting and moving easier.</li>

    <li><strong>3.g</strong> Screw and wedge from inclined plane — a screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder; a wedge is two inclined planes joined back-to-back to split or lift materials.</li>

    <li><strong>3.h.i</strong> Effect of friction — Friction reduces useful output work, converts energy to heat, and thus lowers the efficiency of a machine.</li>

    <li><strong>3.h.ii</strong> Velocity ratio of a machine — is defined as the ratio of distance moved by effort to distance moved by load in ideal (frictionless) conditions.</li>

    <li><strong>3.h.iii</strong> Use of pulleys in daily life — are as follows: lifting water, raising flags, window blinds, clotheslines, and in cranes for construction.</li>

    <li><strong>3.h.iv</strong> Compound machines — are defined as systems where two or more simple machines are combined to perform a complex task with mechanical advantage.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN -->
<h2>↔️ Differentiate Between (Section 4 — p.160)</h2>
<div class="boxed small">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>4.a MA and VR</strong> — MA is load/effort actually obtained; VR is distance_E / distance_L ideally (no friction).</li>
    <li><strong>4.b Input work and output work</strong> — Input work is effort × distance by effort; output work is load × distance lifted (useful work).</li>
    <li><strong>4.c Simple and compound machine</strong> — Simple uses one elementary device; compound combines two or more simple machines together.</li>
    <li><strong>4.d VR and efficiency</strong> — VR is geometric distance ratio; efficiency is (MA/VR)×100% representing losses (friction).</li>
    <li><strong>4.e Pulley and inclined plane</strong> — Pulley changes force direction or multiplies force; inclined plane reduces required effort by increasing distance.</li>
    <li><strong>4.f Screw and wedge</strong> — Screw converts rotation to linear advance; wedge converts applied force into splitting or prying action.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- GIVE REASONS -->
<h2>🤔 Give Reasons (Section 5 — p.160)</h2>
<div class="boxed small">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>5.a</strong> VR > MA because friction and other losses reduce actual mechanical advantage below the ideal geometric ratio.</li>
    <li><strong>5.b</strong> Efficiency never 100% in practice because friction and deformation always waste some input energy as heat.</li>
    <li><strong>5.c</strong> Input work > output work because some input energy is lost to friction and heat; output is only useful part.</li>
    <li><strong>5.d</strong> Easier to climb slanted slope because effort required is less due to longer distance but smaller force compared to vertical climb.</li>
    <li><strong>5.e</strong> Easier with three-pulley system because more supporting rope segments reduce the force needed for same load (greater MA).</li>
    <li><strong>5.f</strong> Wheel and axle is called a continuous lever because the wheel edge and axle center act like many lever positions continuously.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- DIAGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS (textual sketches and descriptions) -->
<h2>📐 Diagrammatic Questions (Section 6 — p.160)</h2>
<p class="small">Below are simple sketches represented in text (draw these on your notebook):</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>6.a i)</strong> <em>Single pulley with VR = 2</em> — draw a movable pulley with two rope segments supporting the load so effort distance is twice load distance.
      <pre>
        (Fixed support)
           |
          ===   ← rope over fixed pulley
           |
          (moveable pulley)
          / \
        load  ← two vertical segments supporting load → VR = 2
      </pre>
    </li>

    <li><strong>6.a ii)</strong> <em>Single pulley with VR = 1</em> — draw a fixed pulley where rope changes direction; effort distance equals load distance.
      <pre>
        effort →
        ---O---  (fixed pulley)
           |
          load
        (VR = 1)
      </pre>
    </li>

    <li><strong>6.a iii)</strong> <em>Block and tackle using 5 pulleys</em> — draw two blocks, one fixed and one movable, each containing several pulleys; show rope wrapped to create five supporting segments.
      <pre>
      fixed block: O O
                  =====  ← rope weaving down and up through movable block
      movable block: O O O  ← total 5 pulleys distributed; count supporting rope segments
      </pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- QUESTIONS BASED ON (UNSEEN) DIAGRAMS -->
<h2>🖼️ Questions Based on Diagrams (Section b & c — p.161)</h2>
<div class="boxed small">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The actual diagrams (marked ****) are not visible here. Below are general answers and the method to answer such diagram questions.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>b.i</strong> Machines made of inclined plane — identify shapes where a long sloping surface is used (ramps, wedges, screws).</li>

    <li><strong>b.ii</strong> Formula for VR of machine X — use VR = distance moved by effort / distance moved by load; for screw use (π·d)/p; for wheel & axle use R_wheel / R_axle.</li>

    <li><strong>b.iii</strong> Which is compound — any machine combining two or more simple machines (e.g., a sewing machine, wheelbarrow) is compound.</li>

    <li><strong>b.iv</strong> Difference between W and Z — compare by type: e.g., W might be simple inclined plane while Z may be pulley — explain their function differences.</li>

    <li><strong>b.v</strong> Difference between X and Z — identify which gives mechanical advantage versus which changes direction or distance, based on shapes.</li>

    <li><strong>c.i</strong> To use less effort — choose the pulley with more supporting rope segments (more mechanical advantage), because effort is shared more.</li>

    <li><strong>c.ii</strong> To lift faster — choose the pulley with VR = 1 or lower VR; single fixed pulley (VR=1) lifts load faster since effort and load move equal distances.</li>

    <li><strong>c.iii</strong> Different efficiency for single pulleys — even single pulleys can differ in friction, axle condition and rope quality so efficiencies differ despite same ideal VR.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- NUMERICAL PROBLEMS — explain, compute where data is enough -->
<h2>🔢 Numerical Problems (Section 7 — pp.161–162)</h2>
<div class="boxed small">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Some questions refer to diagrams or contain partial data. Where numerical diagram details are missing, I give the method and formulas. Where full numerical data is provided I compute final answers.</p>

  <ol>

    <!-- 7.a -->
    <li>
      <strong>7.a</strong> <em>Given:</em> Load = 680 N, Effort = 500 N on an inclined plane (diagram not visible so vertical height or slope length not given).
      <ul>
        <li><strong>i) Output work</strong> — = Load × vertical height (h). <em>(Height h not provided in diagram, so numeric output work cannot be computed.)</em></li>
        <li><strong>ii) Input work</strong> — = Effort × distance moved by effort along plane (d). <em>(d not provided.)</em></li>
        <li><strong>iii) Mechanical advantage</strong> — MA = Load / Effort = 680 / 500 = <strong>1.36</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>iv) Velocity ratio</strong> — VR = distance_E / distance_L = (plane length) / (vertical height). <em>(Requires diagram lengths.)</em></li>
        <li><strong>v) Efficiency</strong> — Efficiency = (MA / VR) × 100% or = (output work / input work) ×100%. <em>(VR or heights missing, so numeric percent cannot be computed.)</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">→ <strong>Method</strong>: If the diagram gives slope length s and height h, compute VR = s/h; output = 680·h; input = 500·s; then efficiency = (680·h)/(500·s)×100%.</p>
    </li>

    <!-- 7.b -->
    <li>
      <strong>7.b</strong> <em>Given:</em> Load = 800 N, block & tackle having 5 pulleys, Effort = 200 N, lift height = 5 m.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assumption:</strong> Here we assume the block & tackle with "5 pulleys" yields <em>5 supporting rope segments</em>, so <strong>VR = 5</strong>. (Textbook problems commonly take VR = number of supporting strands.)</li>

        <li><strong>i) Mechanical advantage</strong> — MA = Load / Effort = 800 / 200 = <strong>4</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>ii) Velocity ratio</strong> — assumed VR = <strong>5</strong> (see assumption above).</li>

        <li><strong>iii) Efficiency</strong> — Efficiency = (MA / VR) × 100% = (4/5)×100% = <strong>80%</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>iv) Output work</strong> — = Load × height = 800 N × 5 m = <strong>4000 J</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>v) Input work</strong> — = Output work / Efficiency = 4000 J / 0.8 = <strong>5000 J</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">→ <strong>Note</strong>: If the intended VR is different in the original diagram, replace VR and recompute efficiency accordingly.</p>
    </li>

    <!-- 7.c -->
    <li>
      <strong>7.c</strong> <em>Given:</em> Radius of wheel = 40 cm = 0.40 m; radius of axle = 0.10 m; Load = 1200 N lifted 4 m; Effort = 400 N.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>i) Mechanical advantage</strong> — MA = Load / Effort = 1200 / 400 = <strong>3</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>ii) Velocity ratio</strong> — VR = R_wheel / R_axle = 0.40 / 0.10 = <strong>4</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>iii) Efficiency</strong> — Efficiency = (MA / VR) × 100% = (3/4)×100% = <strong>75%</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>iv) Output work</strong> — = Load × distance = 1200 N × 4 m = <strong>4800 J</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>v) Input work</strong> — Effort moves distance = VR × load displacement = 4 × 4 m = 16 m. Input work = Effort × distance = 400 N × 16 m = <strong>6400 J</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <!-- 7.d -->
    <li>
      <strong>7.d</strong> <em>Given:</em> Wedge breadth = 8 cm, length = 20 cm, Effort = 400 N, Resisted force (load) = 800 N.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MA</strong> = Load / Effort = 800 / 400 = <strong>2</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>VR</strong> for wedge ≈ length / breadth = 20 / 8 = <strong>2.5</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> = (MA / VR) × 100% = (2 / 2.5)×100% = <strong>80%</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <!-- 7.e -->
    <li>
      <strong>7.e</strong> <em>Given:</em> AC = 16 m (slope length), BC = 5 m (vertical height), MA = 2.5.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>i) Effort</strong> — Effort = Load / MA = <em>(requires load value)</em>. <strong>(Load not given)</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>ii) Velocity ratio</strong> — VR = slope length / height = 16 / 5 = <strong>3.2</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>iii) Efficiency</strong> — Efficiency = (MA / VR) × 100% = (2.5 / 3.2) ×100% ≈ <strong>78.13%</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>iv) Output work</strong> — = Load × height = Load × 5 m. <em>(Numerical value needs Load.)</em></li>

        <li><strong>v) Input work</strong> — = Effort × slope length = (Load/MA) × 16 = Load × 6.4. <em>(Numeric needs Load.)</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">→ So with unknown load, effort & work remain in terms of Load; efficiency and VR are computed above numerically.</p>
    </li>

    <!-- 7.f -->
    <li>
      <strong>7.f</strong> <em>Given:</em> Four-pulley system, Efficiency = 80%. (Diagram and load not provided.)
      <ul>
        <li><strong>i) Effort to lift load</strong> — If Load is L and ideal VR = number of supporting strands (for 4 pulleys often VR=4), then theoretical effort (ideal) = L/VR. Considering efficiency η, actual effort E = L / MA and MA = η·VR. So E = L / (η·VR). Numeric requires L and VR from diagram.</li>

        <li><strong>ii) Output work when load lifted 6 m</strong> — = L × 6 (needs L).</li>

        <li><strong>iii) Input work</strong> — = Output work / η = (L×6) / 0.8 = 7.5·L.</li>

        <li><strong>iv) Mechanical advantage</strong> — MA = η × VR. If VR is known from rope segments then MA = 0.8×VR.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">→ <strong>Method</strong>: Provide load and rope arrangement to compute numeric effort and works.</p>
    </li>

    <!-- 7.g -->
    <li>
      <strong>7.g</strong> <em>Given:</em> Screw head diameter = 1.5 cm (d = 1.5 cm), pitch = 1 cm, screw magnifies effort by 4 times (MA = 4).
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VR</strong> ≈ (π·d) / p = π × 1.5 / 1 ≈ 3.1416 × 1.5 = 4.7124 (≈ <strong>4.712</strong>).</li>
        <li><strong>MA</strong> = given = <strong>4</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> = (MA / VR) × 100% = (4 / 4.7124)×100% ≈ <strong>84.9%</strong> (approx.).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

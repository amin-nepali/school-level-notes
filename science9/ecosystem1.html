    <!-- Long Answer Questions -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>📖 Long Answer Type Questions (Definition Style)</h2>

        <h3>a. Biotic & Abiotic Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Biotic components are defined as living organisms in an ecosystem (producers, consumers, decomposers).</li>
            <li>Abiotic components are defined as non-living factors in an ecosystem (temperature, water, light, soil, air).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Green Plants as Producers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Green plants are called producers because they make their own food using chlorophyll, carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight.</li>
            <li>They are the starting point of energy in all food chains.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c. Key Terms</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Term</th>
                <th>Definition</th>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>Producer</td><td>Defined as an organism that makes its own food (e.g., plants)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Ecosystem</td><td>Known as a community of living and non-living factors interacting</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Decomposer</td><td>Organism that breaks down dead matter (e.g., fungi)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Food web</td><td>Called a network of interconnected food chains</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Parasitism</td><td>Defined as a relationship where one species benefits and the other is harmed (e.g., tapeworm)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Symbiosis</td><td>Known as a close long-term relationship between two different species</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Commensalism</td><td>Defined as a relationship where one species benefits and the other is neither helped nor harmed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Trophic level</td><td>Defined as the position of an organism in a food chain</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h3>d. Increased Tertiary Consumers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased tertiary consumers cause over-predation on secondary consumers, so their population decreases.</li>
            <li>Primary consumer (herbivore) population increases due to fewer secondary consumers.</li>
            <li>Over-grazing by herbivores decreases producer (plant) population → ecosystem imbalance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>e. Abiotic Factors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Abiotic factors affecting the environment are given below:
                <ul>
                    <li>Light (Solar Energy)</li>
                    <li>Temperature</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                    <li>Soil</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Temperature is defined as crucial because it controls metabolic rate and enzyme function; life exists within specific temperature ranges, extremes limit species distribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>f. Food Chain</h3>
        <div class="diagram">
            Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake
        </div>
        <p>Food chain is defined as a linear transfer of energy from one organism to another. Energy is lost at each trophic level.</p>

        <h3>g. Grassland Ecosystem</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Grassland ecosystem is defined as an ecosystem dominated by grasses with few trees, found in areas with moderate rainfall.</li>
            <li>Producers: Grasses</li>
            <li>Consumers: Grazing animals (zebra, deer) and carnivores (lion)</li>
            <li>Abiotic: Moderate rainfall, fertile soil, common seasonal fires</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>h. Impacts of Climate Change</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of biodiversity: Habitats like coral reefs are destroyed (bleaching)</li>
            <li>Species shift: Organisms migrate to find suitable temperatures</li>
            <li>Disrupted cycles: Timing of plant flowering and animal migration affected</li>
            <li>Extreme events: Droughts, floods, wildfires destroy habitats</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>i. Migration Effects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Source ecosystem: Less grazing pressure on plants; temporary food shortage for predators</li>
            <li>Destination ecosystem: More grazing pressure; temporary food for predators; adds nutrients via waste</li>
            <li>Migration helps maintain seasonal energy redistribution and ecosystem balance</li>
        </ul>

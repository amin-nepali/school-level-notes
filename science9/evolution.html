      <h2 style="color:var(--accent)">3. Long answer type questions — Short, memorable paragraphs & points</h2>

      <div class="q">
        <h3>a. Mention any four evidences of organic evolution.</h3>
        <p>
          1. <strong>Fossil record:</strong> shows succession and transitional forms; layered fossils indicate change through geological time.<br>
          2. <strong>Comparative anatomy:</strong> homologous organs suggest common ancestry; vestigial organs indicate loss of former function.<br>
          3. <strong>Embryology:</strong> early embryos of different animals show similar stages — common developmental patterns.<br>
          4. <strong>Biochemistry & genetics:</strong> similarity in DNA, proteins and metabolic pathways among species indicates shared heritage.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="q">
        <h3>b. How do homologous and analogous organs give evidence of evolution?</h3>
        <p>
          • <strong>Homologous organs:</strong> similar structure and origin but different functions — indicate divergence from a common ancestor (e.g., forelimbs of vertebrates).<br>
          • <strong>Analogous organs:</strong> similar functions but different structures and origins — indicate convergent evolution where unrelated organisms adapt to similar environments (e.g., wings for flying in birds and insects).<br>
          → <em>Together:</em> homologous organs support common descent; analogous organs show adaptation by natural selection to similar problems.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="q">
        <h3>c. What are vestigial organs? How are they different from homologous organs?</h3>
        <p>
          • <strong>Vestigial organs:</strong> reduced or non-functional structures that were functional in ancestors (e.g., human appendix, pelvic bones in whales).<br>
          • <strong>Difference from homologous organs:</strong> homologous organs emphasize common structural origin despite differing functions; vestigial organs emphasize loss or reduction of function over time. <br>
          → A vestigial organ can be homologous to a functional organ in an ancestor (so categories can overlap).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="q">
        <h3>d. Write in short about connecting links and embryonic evidence.</h3>
        <p>
          • <strong>Connecting links (transitional forms):</strong> fossils or living species that show intermediate features between two groups (e.g., Archaeopteryx — reptile + bird features).<br>
          • <strong>Embryonic evidence:</strong> embryos of diverse animals show similar early stages (e.g., pharyngeal pouches in vertebrate embryos) — suggests common ancestry and conserved developmental genes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="q">
        <h3>e. Write in short about Lamarckism, natural selection and variation.</h3>
        <p>
          • <strong>Lamarckism:</strong> theory by Lamarck — use and disuse of organs and inheritance of acquired traits drive evolution; organisms actively adapt during their lifetime.<br>
          • <strong>Natural selection (Darwin):</strong> individuals vary; more offspring are produced than survive; those with favorable traits survive and reproduce — traits become more common.<br>
          • <strong>Variation:</strong> natural differences among individuals (heritable + non-heritable); variation is the raw material on which natural selection acts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="q">
        <h3>f. What are the drawbacks of Lamarckism and Darwinism?</h3>
        <p>
          • <strong>Lamarckism drawbacks:</strong> lacks evidence for inheritance of acquired characters; no mechanism to explain how acquired changes are passed to offspring.<br>
          • <strong>Darwinism drawbacks (as originally proposed):</strong> did not explain the source of variation or the mechanism of inheritance (Mendelian genetics and mutation theory solved these later); gradualism may not explain sudden large changes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="q">
        <h3>g. What is natural selection? How does it lead to evolution?</h3>
        <p>
          • <strong>Definition:</strong> process where individuals with advantageous heritable traits survive and reproduce more successfully than others, changing the population over generations.<br>
          • <strong>How it leads to evolution:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Variation exists among individuals.</li>
            <li>Environmental pressures create a struggle for resources.</li>
            <li>Individuals with favorable traits survive and reproduce.</li>
            <li>Favorable traits increase in frequency over generations.</li>
            <li>Accumulation of changes may produce new species (speciation).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="q">
        <h3>h. Mention the major points of Darwinism.</h3>
        <p>
          1. <strong>Variation:</strong> individuals in a species show variation.<br>
          2. <strong>Overproduction:</strong> organisms produce more offspring than can survive.<br>
          3. <strong>Struggle for existence:</strong> competition for limited resources.<br>
          4. <strong>Natural selection:</strong> differential survival and reproduction due to favorable traits.<br>
          5. <strong>Survival of the fittest:</strong> those best adapted leave more offspring.<br>
          6. <strong>Gradualism & common descent:</strong> species change slowly and share common ancestors.

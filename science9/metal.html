            <div class="question">3. Long Answer Type Questions</div>
            
            <div class="sub-question">Enlist any five properties of metals and non-metals each.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <span class="highlight">Properties of Metals:</span> They are lustrous with a shiny surface. They are malleable and can be beaten into thin sheets. They are ductile and can be drawn into wires. They are good conductors of heat and electricity. They form basic oxides when they react with oxygen.<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">Properties of Non-metals:</span> They are generally dull with no shine. They are brittle and break easily. They cannot be drawn into wires. They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. They form acidic oxides when they react with oxygen.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-question">Give an example of metal which: i) is a liquid at room temperature. ii) is a poor conductor of electricity. iii) can be easily cut with a knife.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                i) <span class="highlight">Mercury (Hg)</span> is the only metal that exists in liquid state at room temperature.<br>
                ii) <span class="highlight">Lead (Pb)</span> is a relatively poor conductor of electricity compared to other metals.<br>
                iii) <span class="highlight">Sodium (Na)</span> or <span class="highlight">Potassium (K)</span> are soft metals that can be easily cut with a knife.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-question">What would you observe when zinc is added to a dilute hydrochloric acid? Write the chemical reaction that takes place.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                When zinc is added to dilute hydrochloric acid, we observe rapid bubbling or effervescence. This happens because <span class="highlight">hydrogen gas</span> is released during the reaction. The zinc metal dissolves gradually in the acid. The chemical reaction is:<br>
                <div class="formula">Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)</div>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-question">Write the equation for the reaction of: i) calcium and water ii) sodium and oxygen iii) magnesium and hydrochloric acid</div>
            <div class="answer">
                i) Calcium and water:<br>
                <div class="formula">Ca + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + H₂</div><br>
                ii) Sodium and oxygen:<br>
                <div class="formula">4Na + O₂ → 2Na₂O</div><br>
                iii) Magnesium and hydrochloric acid:<br>
                <div class="formula">Mg + 2HCl → MgCl₂ + H₂</div>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-question">An element reacts with oxygen to give a compound with a high melting point. This compound is also soluble in water. Which element - calcium or carbon is it likely to be?</div>
            <div class="answer">The element is likely to be <span class="highlight">Calcium (Ca)</span>. When calcium reacts with oxygen, it forms <span class="highlight">Calcium Oxide (CaO)</span>, which is an ionic compound. Ionic compounds have high melting points because of strong electrostatic forces. Calcium oxide is also soluble in water, forming calcium hydroxide. Carbon forms covalent compounds with lower melting points.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">There are three materials A, B and C. Materials A and C are soft and B is lustrous and hard; but material B is dull and not very hard. Identify the metals and non-metals from A, B and C.</div>
            <div class="answer">Based on the given properties, <span class="highlight">Material B</span> is likely a <span class="highlight">Metal</span> because it is described as lustrous and hard, which are typical metal properties. <span class="highlight">Materials A and C</span> are likely <span class="highlight">Non-metals</span> because they are soft and dull, which are characteristics of non-metals.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Graphite and iodine are non-metals but they shine. Explain it with suitable reasons.</div>
            <div class="answer"><span class="highlight">Iodine</span> is a non-metal that shines because it has a special molecular structure that can reflect light, giving it a metallic appearance. <span class="highlight">Graphite</span> shines because it has <span class="highlight">delocalised electrons</span> in its layered structure. These free electrons can move and reflect light, similar to how metals reflect light, which gives graphite its lustre.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Compare between metals and non-metals on the basis of their chemical properties.</div>
            <div class="answer">Metals form <span class="highlight">basic oxides</span> when they react with oxygen, while non-metals form <span class="highlight">acidic oxides</span>. Metals lose electrons easily to form <span class="highlight">cations</span> (positive ions), whereas non-metals gain electrons to form <span class="highlight">anions</span> (negative ions). Metals react with acids to produce hydrogen gas, but non-metals generally do not react with acids.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Write any three points to show the importance of each: i) zinc ii) sodium iii) potassium</div>
            <div class="answer">
                i) <span class="highlight">Zinc:</span> Used in galvanisation to prevent rusting. Essential for immune system function. Important for wound healing.<br><br>
                ii) <span class="highlight">Sodium:</span> Essential for nerve impulse transmission. Maintains fluid balance in body. Used in making soap and glass.<br><br>
                iii) <span class="highlight">Potassium:</span> Crucial for heart function and muscle contractions. Important component of plant fertilisers. Maintains proper cell function.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-question">Mercury and lead are harmful metals for human beings. How are these metals harmful? Suggest your views.</div>
            <div class="answer">Both mercury and lead accumulate in the body and cause serious damage. They affect the <span class="highlight">nervous system</span> causing brain damage and memory problems. They damage the kidneys and affect their filtering function. Lead specifically damages blood formation causing anemia. My view is that strict regulations should be placed on these metals. Safe disposal methods must be followed, and industries should find safer alternatives.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">You are given a bulb, one metre copper wire, a switch and a battery. How could you use them to distinguish the samples of metals and non-metals? Could write the usefulness of this test in distinguishing metals and non-metals?</div>
            <div class="answer">Connect all components in a <span class="highlight">series circuit</span>: battery, switch, sample material (between two connection points), and bulb. If the sample is a metal, it will conduct electricity and the <span class="highlight">bulb will glow</span>. If it's a non-metal, it won't conduct electricity and the bulb won't glow. This test is very useful because conductivity is a fundamental difference between metals and non-metals. It gives quick and clear results.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Compare the properties of a typical metal and non-metal based on the following: i) lustre ii) conductivity iii) ductility</div>
            <div class="answer">
                i) <span class="highlight">Lustre:</span> Metals have a shiny, reflective surface (metallic lustre). Non-metals are generally dull with no shine.<br><br>
                ii) <span class="highlight">Conductivity:</span> Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity. Non-metals are poor conductors (insulators).<br><br>
                iii) <span class="highlight">Ductility:</span> Metals are ductile and can be drawn into thin wires. Non-metals are non-ductile and brittle, breaking when stretched.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-question">Make a list of any five sources and any two deficiency symptoms and importance of the following metallic minerals essential for human body.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <span class="highlight">Iron (Fe):</span><br>
                Sources: Spinach, red meat, lentils, liver, fortified cereals.<br>
                Importance: Forms hemoglobin in blood, carries oxygen to cells.<br>
                Deficiency: Anemia, fatigue and weakness.<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">Zinc (Zn):</span><br>
                Sources: Meat, seafood, nuts, whole grains, dairy products.<br>
                Importance: Supports immune system, wound healing.<br>
                Deficiency: Slow wound healing, weakened immunity.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-question">If you are given two samples, how do you differentiate which one is metal and which one is non-metal?</div>
            <div class="answer">Test their <span class="highlight">electrical conductivity</span> by connecting them in a circuit with a bulb. If the bulb glows, it's a metal. Test <span class="highlight">malleability</span> by hammering them. If the sample flattens into a sheet, it's a metal. If it breaks or crumbles into pieces, it's a non-metal. You can also check for lustre and hardness.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">You came to know that diamond is the hardest non-metal and mercury is a soft metal. What questions are raised in your mind?</div>
            <div class="answer">Several questions arise about these exceptions to typical properties. Why is diamond so extremely hard when most non-metals are soft? Why is mercury liquid at room temperature when metals are usually solid? Are their other physical and chemical properties also exceptional? What makes their structures so different from other materials in their groups? How do these exceptions help us understand material properties better?</div>

            <div class="question">4. Give Reasons (Concise)</div>
            
            <div class="sub-question">Ionic compounds have high melting points.</div>
            <div class="answer">Strong <span class="highlight">electrostatic forces</span> hold positive and negative ions together in a crystal lattice structure. A large amount of energy is needed to break these strong bonds and separate the ions, which results in very high melting points for ionic compounds.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Metals are lustrous.</div>
            <div class="answer">Free electrons present on the metal surface can absorb light energy and then re-emit it. This absorption and re-emission of light gives metals their characteristic <span class="highlight">shining or reflective surface</span>, which we call metallic lustre.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Metals are ductile.</div>
            <div class="answer">In metals, layers of atoms can slide over one another when stress or force is applied. The metallic bonds are flexible and don't break easily. This allows metals to be stretched or <span class="highlight">drawn into thin wires</span> without breaking.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Lead is harmful to humans.</div>
            <div class="answer">Lead is a toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the body over time and cannot be easily removed. It causes severe damage to the <span class="highlight">nervous system</span> affecting brain function, damages kidneys, and interferes with blood formation causing various health problems.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Metals are good conductors of electricity.</div>
            <div class="answer">Metals possess <span class="highlight">mobile or free electrons</span> that are not bound to any particular atom. These electrons can move freely throughout the metal structure and can easily carry electric current from one point to another, making metals excellent conductors.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Metals are used to make cooking utensils.</div>
            <div class="answer">Metals are <span class="highlight">good conductors of heat</span>, which allows them to transfer heat efficiently from the flame to the food. They also have <span class="highlight">high melting points</span>, which means they won't melt or deform when exposed to cooking temperatures, providing durability.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Electroplating of copper can be made on iron but not on silver.</div>
            <div class="answer">Copper is <span class="highlight">less reactive than iron</span> in the reactivity series, so it can form a stable protective coat on iron. However, copper is <span class="highlight">more reactive than silver</span>, which makes it difficult to form stable plating on silver as the coating may not adhere properly.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Sodium is kept immersed in kerosene oil.</div>
            <div class="answer">Sodium is a highly reactive metal that reacts vigorously with oxygen in air and moisture in the atmosphere. These reactions can be violent and dangerous, producing heat and potentially causing fires. Kerosene oil prevents sodium from coming in contact with air and water, keeping it safe.</div>

            <div class="question">6. Analysis of the Test Set-up</div>
            
            <div class="sub-question">How could you use the hammer to distinguish between the samples of metals and non-metals?</div>
            <div class="answer">Use the hammer to test <span class="highlight">malleability and brittleness</span> of the samples. When you strike a metal sample with a hammer, it will <span class="highlight">flatten</span> and spread into a thin sheet because metals are malleable. When you strike a non-metal, it will <span class="highlight">break</span> into pieces or crumble into powder because non-metals are brittle.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Resketch the given diagram by using a battery, wires, a switch and a bulb to test the samples as metals or non-metals.</div>
            <div class="answer">The circuit should connect all components in series: the <span class="highlight">battery, switch, bulb, and sample material</span> (placed between connection clips A and B). When the switch is closed, if the sample conducts electricity, the circuit will be complete and the bulb will glow. This tests the conductivity property to distinguish metals from non-metals.</div>

            <div class="sub-question">Assess the usefulness of this set up as shown in the diagram to distinguish between metals and non-metals?</div>
            <div class="answer">This setup is highly useful for testing <span class="highlight">electrical conductivity</span>, which is a key difference between metals and non-metals. If the bulb <span class="highlight">glows</span> when the sample is placed in the circuit, it indicates the sample is a <span class="highlight">metal</span> (good conductor). If the bulb <span class="highlight">doesn't glow</span>, the sample is a <span class="highlight">non-metal</span> (insulator). This gives clear, immediate, and reliable results.</div>

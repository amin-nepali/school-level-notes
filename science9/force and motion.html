<h1>Force and Laws of Motion – Class 9 Notes</h1>


<!-- SHORT ANSWERS -->
<div class="card">
<h2>📝 Short Answer Type Questions</h2>

<p><b>1. Relation between inertia and mass:</b><br>
Inertia is the property that resists any change in motion, and mass is the measure of inertia. A body with greater mass has greater inertia, meaning it is harder to start or stop its motion.</p>

<p><b>2. Newton's first law of motion:</b><br>
A body remains at rest or moves uniformly in a straight line unless an external unbalanced force acts on it. This law explains how objects naturally maintain their state of motion.</p>

<p><b>3. Newton's second law of motion:</b><br>
The rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the applied force and occurs in the direction of the force acting on it.</p>

<p><b>4. Newton’s third law of motion:</b><br>
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Forces always occur in pairs that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.</p>

<p><b>5. Principle on which a rocket works:</b><br>
A rocket works on Newton’s third law of motion. The gases expelled downward (action) produce an upward thrust (reaction), lifting the rocket.</p>

<p><b>6. Definition of force according to Newton’s first law:</b><br>
Force is any external influence that changes or tends to change the state of rest or uniform motion of a body.</p>

<p><b>7. Relation between acceleration, mass & force:</b><br>
Acceleration depends directly on force and inversely on mass. A = F/m means greater force produces more acceleration, while greater mass produces less acceleration.</p>

<p><b>8. Definitions:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Inertia:</b> The tendency of a body to resist changes in motion.</li>
<li><b>Plasticity:</b> The property of substances to undergo permanent deformation.</li>
<li><b>Displacement:</b> The shortest distance between initial and final points.</li>
<li><b>Acceleration:</b> Rate of change of velocity per unit time.</li>
<li><b>Elasticity:</b> Ability of a material to return to its original shape.</li>
<li><b>Balanced force:</b> Equal forces that produce no change in motion.</li>
<li><b>Slope:</b> Ratio of rise to run in a graph.</li>
<li><b>Run:</b> Horizontal change in a graph.</li>
<li><b>Rise:</b> Vertical change in a graph.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>9. Retardation:</b><br>
Retardation is negative acceleration that decreases the velocity of a moving body, acting opposite to its motion.</p>

<p><b>10. SI units of acceleration and force:</b><br>
Acceleration is measured in m/s² and force in Newton (N).</p>

<p><b>11. Uniform acceleration:</b><br>
A body has uniform acceleration when it experiences equal changes in velocity in equal intervals of time.</p>

<!-- LONG ANSWERS -->
<div class="card">
<h2>✍️ Long Answer Type Questions</h2>

<p><b>1. Derive F = m × a:</b><br>
Force is defined as the rate of change of momentum. Momentum is mass × velocity. For constant mass, momentum change becomes m(v−u). Dividing by time gives m(v−u)/t = ma. Thus, force becomes equal to mass multiplied by acceleration.</p>

<p><b>2. Why action & reaction do not balance each other?</b><br>
Action and reaction occur on two different bodies, so they cannot cancel each other. For example, when we walk, our foot pushes the ground backward while the ground pushes us forward. Similarly, a boat moves forward when we push water backward with an oar.</p>

<p><b>3. Newton’s second law with examples:</b><br>
Newton’s second law states that force produces acceleration in the direction of applied force. When we kick a football, it accelerates based on the force applied. Similarly, pushing a shopping cart harder increases its acceleration depending on the force and its mass.</p>

<p><b>4. Why first law is called law of inertia?</b><br>
Newton’s first law explains that bodies resist changes in their state of rest or constant motion unless forced to change. This resistance is called inertia. Since the law completely describes inertia, it is popularly known as the law of inertia.</p>

<p><b>5. Retardation & acceleration of a body with uniform velocity:</b><br>
Retardation is acceleration that reduces velocity. When a body moves with uniform velocity, its velocity does not change over time, so its acceleration is zero. Uniform velocity means no speeding up or slowing down.</p>

<p><b>6. Newton’s third law & gun recoil:</b><br>
Newton’s third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. When a bullet is fired forward, the gun experiences an opposite backward force. This backward movement of the gun is called recoil, caused by the reaction force on the gun.</p>

<p><b>7. Proving the equations of motion:</b><br>
Using the velocity–time graph, we obtain three kinematic equations. From the slope and area relations, we derive v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², and v² = u² + 2as. These equations describe the motion of bodies under uniform acceleration.</p>

<p><b>8. Why loaded vehicles face higher accident risk at high speed?</b><br>
Loaded vehicles have greater mass, so they possess greater inertia. At high speed, they cannot stop quickly because inertia resists the change in motion. This increases stopping distance and the chance of losing control, leading to a higher probability of accidents.</p>

  <h2>4. Give Reasons</h2>
  <ul class="short">
    <li>Shaking a tree branch: Fruits fall because they resist motion and remain at rest due to inertia.</li>
    <li>Swimmer pushes water back: Water is pushed backward; swimmer moves forward via reaction force.</li>
    <li>Cricketer moves hands backward: Hands move backward to increase impact time, reducing catching force.</li>
    <li>Running after bus: Person runs forward as body continues moving due to inertia.</li>
    <li>Bus stops suddenly: Passengers jerk forward because their bodies resist sudden motion change.</li>
    <li>Gun recoils: Gun moves backward as bullet shoots forward due to reaction.</li>
    <li>Truck stops slower than car: Truck’s larger mass produces greater inertia, requiring longer stopping distance.</li>
    <li>Jumping on concrete: Feet hurt more due to higher impact force on hard surface.</li>

                <strong>Ionic compounds have high melting points.</strong>
                <div class="answer-box">
                    Strong **electrostatic forces** hold positive and negative ions together. A large amount of energy is needed to break this crystal lattice structure, resulting in high melting points. (28 words)

            <li>
                <strong>Metals are lustrous.</strong>
                <div class="answer-box">
                    Free electrons on the surface absorb light and re-emit it, giving metals a characteristic **shining or reflective surface** (metallic lustre). (24 words)

                <div class="answer-box">
                    Layers of atoms can slide over one another when stress is applied, allowing them to be stretched or **drawn into thin wires**. (23 words)

                <strong>Electroplating of copper can be made on iron but not on silver.</strong>
                <div class="answer-box">
                    Copper is **less reactive than iron**, ensuring a stable coat. It is **more reactive than silver**, making stable plating difficult on silver. (28 words)

                <strong>Sodium is kept immersed in kerosene oil.</strong>
                <div class="answer-box">
                    Sodium is highly reactive. It reacts vigorously with air (oxygen) and moisture, so kerosene oil prevents its contact and stops dangerous reactions. (26 words)

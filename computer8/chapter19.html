        <h2>4. Give Reasons</h2>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                <strong>Ionic compounds have high melting points.</strong>
                <p>Because they are formed by the strong electrostatic force of attraction between positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions). A large amount of heat energy is required to overcome this strong force and break the crystal lattice structure, leading to high melting points.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Metals are lustrous.</strong>
                <p>Because the free electrons present on the surface of metals absorb energy from incident light and then re-emit it. This gives metals a shining or reflective surface, known as <strong>metallic lustre</strong>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Metals are ductile.</strong>
                <p>Because of their specific crystalline structure, which allows the layers of atoms to slide over one another when a force is applied (without breaking the metallic bonds). This property, known as <strong>ductility</strong>, allows them to be drawn into thin wires.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lead is harmful to humans.</strong>
                <p>Because it is a toxic heavy metal that can accumulate in the body (in the bones and soft tissues), causing damage to the nervous system, kidneys, and blood formation. Lead poisoning can lead to serious health issues, especially in children.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Metals are good conductors of electricity.</strong>
                <p>Because they possess **mobile (or free) electrons** in their structure. When an electric potential difference is applied, these free electrons can easily move and carry the electric current through the metal.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Metals are used to make cooking utensils.</strong>
                <p>Because metals are **good conductors of heat** and have **high melting points**. This allows them to transfer heat efficiently to the food and withstand the high temperatures used for cooking without melting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Electroplating of copper can be made on iron but not on silver.</strong>
                <p>This is because **copper is less reactive than iron** but **more reactive than silver**. For effective and long-lasting electroplating, the metal being deposited (copper) must be less reactive than the base metal (iron) to prevent displacement. Since copper is more reactive than silver, it would not form a stable or effective plating layer on silver under normal conditions.</p>
                </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sodium is kept immersed in kerosene oil.</strong>
                <p>Sodium is a highly reactive metal. It reacts vigorously and exothermically with **oxygen** (in the air) and **water** (including moisture in the air), which can cause a fire or explosion. Kerosene oil is a non-polar hydrocarbon that does not react with sodium and prevents its contact with air and moisture, thus protecting it from reaction.</p>

Materials $\text{A}$ and $\text{C}$ are soft and $\text{B}$ is lustrous and hard; but material $\text{B}$ is dull and not very hard. Identify the metals and non-metals from $\text{A}$, $\text{B}$ and $\text{C}$.</strong>
                <p>The prompt contains a slight contradiction in the description of B (lustrous and hard, but dull and not very hard). Assuming the properties are intended to represent a clear distinction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**A and C are soft:** Soft materials are generally **non-metals** (like Sulphur, Phosphorus) or very soft metals (like Sodium, Potassium). Given the limited choices, it's safer to identify them as non-metals first.</li>
                    <li>**B is lustrous and hard:** **Metals** are typically lustrous and hard. Even if a metal is "not very hard," it is still generally harder than the soft non-metals.</li>
                    <li>**Identification based on typical properties:**
                        <ul>
                            <li>**Metal:** **Material $\text{B}$** (Lustrous and Hard)</li>
                            <li>**Non-metals:** **Materials $\text{A}$ and $\text{C}$** (Soft)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <strong>Graphite and iodine are non-metals but they shine. Explain it with suitable reasons.</strong>
                <p>The property of shining (lustre) is generally associated with metals, but Graphite and Iodine are exceptions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Iodine:** Solid iodine crystals have a molecular lattice structure that allows for the reflection of light, giving them a violet-black, metallic sheen.</li>
                    <li>**Graphite:** It has a unique layered structure. The layers are held by weak forces, but within each layer, carbon atoms are strongly bonded. The presence of **delocalised electrons** in the layers (similar to metals, but only in the plane of the layers) allows it to absorb and re-emit light, giving it a black, shiny appearance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

        <h2>üìñ Long Answer Questions (Max 30 words)</h2>

        <div class="question long">
            <div class="question-text">a. Write the physical properties of acids.</div>
            <div class="answer">Acids are chemical compounds that taste sour when dissolved in water. They conduct electricity due to hydrogen ion presence. Acids turn blue litmus paper red, indicating their acidic nature. They react with metals like zinc and magnesium, releasing hydrogen gas bubbles. Acids corrode metals and have a pH value less than 7.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question long">
            <div class="question-text">b. What are the properties of bases?</div>
            <div class="answer">Bases are chemical compounds that taste bitter and feel slippery or soapy to touch. They conduct electricity in aqueous solutions. Bases turn red litmus paper blue, showing their basic nature. They react with acids in neutralization reactions, forming salts and water. Bases have pH values greater than 7 and release hydroxide ions.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question long">
            <div class="question-text">c. Write the properties and types of salts.</div>
            <div class="answer">Salts are neutral ionic compounds formed when acids react with bases through neutralization reactions. They have crystalline structure and conduct electricity when dissolved. Types include normal salts (completely neutralized), acidic salts (partially neutralized acids), and basic salts (partially neutralized bases). Salts are generally soluble in water and have various colors and tastes.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question long">
            <div class="question-text">d. A solution turns red litmus paper blue. Briefly explain the nature of the solution.</div>
            <div class="answer">The solution is basic or alkaline in nature because it contains hydroxide ions (OH-) which are responsible for turning red litmus paper blue. Basic solutions have pH values greater than 7. The hydroxide ions neutralize hydrogen ions, creating an alkaline environment. Common basic solutions include soap water, lime water, and sodium hydroxide solution.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question long">
            <div class="question-text">e. Write any two uses of acids, and salts in everyday life.</div>
            <div class="answer">Acids have numerous applications: vinegar (acetic acid) is used for food preservation and cooking, while citric acid is added to beverages for taste. Salts are equally important: table salt (sodium chloride) is essential for food seasoning and body functions, while calcium chloride is used for de-icing roads in winter and as a drying agent.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question long">
            <div class="question-text">f. You have three test tubes: one contains saline solution, another contains lemon water, and the third contains liquid soap. You are given blue litmus paper. How will you identify which test tube contains the salt, the acid, and the base?</div>
            <div class="answer">Dip blue litmus paper into each test tube separately. Lemon water will turn the blue litmus paper red because it contains citric acid. Liquid soap will keep the litmus paper blue or make it darker blue as it's basic. Saline solution will show no color change as salt is neutral, keeping the litmus paper blue without any chemical reaction occurring.</div>

            <div class="question-text">a. What does the diagram show about the test on the solutions in beaker A and beaker B?</div>
            <div class="answer">The diagram shows litmus paper testing acidic solution (Beaker A) and basic solution (Beaker B) with color changes.</div>

        <div class="question diagram">
            <div class="question-text">b. Identify the type of solution in Beaker A and Beaker B.</div>
            <div class="answer">Beaker A contains acidic solution (turns litmus red). Beaker B contains basic solution (turns litmus blue/green).</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question diagram">
            <div class="question-text">c. What colour change would you observe if a few drops of methyl orange are added to the solution in beaker A?</div>
            <div class="answer">Methyl orange would turn red/pink when added to the acidic solution in beaker A.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question diagram">
            <div class="question-text">d. What would happen if the solution in beaker B is replaced with a salt solution?</div>
            <div class="answer">If replaced with salt solution, litmus paper would show no color change indicating neutral nature.</div>

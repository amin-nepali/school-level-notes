    <div class="question">a. Discuss the various features of Scratch.</div>
    <div class="answer">Scratch has visual block-based coding, is beginner-friendly, lets us make games and animations, has many sprites and backdrops, and it does not have syntax errors.</div>

    <div class="question">b. "Scratch is the best programming tool for learners." Explain.</div>
    <div class="answer">Scratch is best because it is easy to use, helps us think logically and be creative, does not have errors in syntax, and gives instant results on the screen.</div>

    <div class="question">c. Define stage area in Scratch.</div>
    <div class="answer">The stage area is where sprites act and where we see our project happen.</div>

    <div class="question">d. What is a sprite in Scratch? Why is it important?</div>
    <div class="answer">A sprite is a character or object that we control. It is important because it is the main actor in the project.</div>

    <div class="question">e. Discuss the use of code area in Scratch.</div>
    <div class="answer">The code area is where we put blocks together to make the sprite do actions.</div>

    <div class="question">f. If you need to change the background of the stage, which option would you choose?</div>
    <div class="answer">I would click “Choose a Backdrop” and then pick from the library, paint my own, or upload an image.</div>

    <div class="question">g. What is the role of a sprite in a project?</div>
    <div class="answer">Sprites do the actions we program and they can work with the stage, backdrops, and other sprites.</div>

    <div class="question">h. How can you move a sprite across the stage?</div>
    <div class="answer">I can use Motion blocks like “Move steps”, “Go to x y”, or “Glide to” to move the sprite.</div>

    <div class="question">i. If you want to make a sprite perform an action many times, which block would you use?</div>
    <div class="answer">I would use the “Repeat” block for a fixed number of times or the “Forever” block for endless repeating.</div>

    <div class="question">j. What is the function of the "When Green Flag Clicked" block?</div>
    <div class="answer">It starts the program when I click the green flag.</div>

    <div class="question">k. How can you add and change the backdrop?</div>
    <div class="answer">I can click “Choose a Backdrop” in the stage area, then pick from the library, paint, or upload my own. I can also edit it with the Backdrop Editor.</div>
